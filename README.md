# fashionmintedit

<h1>This is the SECOND version and first official edit of the FashionMint.com project I had been working on</h1>

<i>Please note that there were/are videos that were added to this site, but I struggled with adding mp4 and ogg files to github.</i>

Although this is an edit, this is certainly not the last. This has helped me, thus far with the learning process. 

I intend to add several more logos to the site via CSS3 and/or JQuery or JS. 

This is a completely static page, so there are no server side issues or interactions available at the moment. 

Please feel free to message me with any comments or questions, or fork and work on this project as you like. Thanks, Emily Jeffery.
